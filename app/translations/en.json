This will be made possible through LerGO's open source cloud platform, which leverages the goodwill of the community, enabling contributors to easily create animated & interactive lessons. Kids will use these lessons as a free alternative to private tutoring/lessons, to self-learn all school subjects, enjoyably and at their own pace. LerGO was founded by Nava Levy and is being operated by the  NGO LerGO - Educate Yourself (R.A.) through volunteers. With its beta site based in Israel, LerGO already includes thousands of interactive lessons and activities that include tens of thousands questions which you can already use with your kids or students today. These lessons were created entirely by volunteers: teachers, parents, NGOs and also good students.  We need your help to create more lessons as well as to distribute these lessons to teachers, parents and kids. Thank you!",

Our goal is to provide every child with free access to high quality and interactive online lessons. This will be made possible via LerGO's cloud platform that leverages the goodwill of the community, enabling it to easily create educational content. Kids can use these lessons to self learn all school subjects, enjoyably and at their own pace. LerGO was founded by Nava Levy and is being operated by the  NGO LerGO - Educate Yourself (R.A.) through volunteers. LerGO features today hundreds of lessons and thousands of questions which you can already use with your kids or students today. These lessons were created entirely by volunteers: teachers, parents, NGOs and also good students.  We need your help to create more lessons as well as to distribute these lessons to teachers, parents and kids. Thank you!",
